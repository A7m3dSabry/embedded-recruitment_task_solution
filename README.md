## Logical Bugs
### Error Handling when client Disconnected

#### Problem
```rust
if bytes_read == 0 {
    info!("Client disconnected.");
    return Ok(()); // <- Error -------------
}
```
description: when the client disconnected it should return `Err` to tell the Thread to exit the loop
#### Solution
```rust
if bytes_read == 0 {
    info!("Client disconnected.");
    return Err(io::Error::new(ErrorKind::ConnectionReset, "Client disconnected."));
}
```
---

### Error Handling when Decoding Failed
#### problem
```rust
} else {
    error!("Failed to decode message"); // <--- Only Logging but no error handling
}
```
description: when decoding error happen there is no handling for it except logging it.

#### Solution
```rust
Err(e) => {
    error!("Failed to decode message: {}", e);
    
    // note the return Err here will cause the thread to exit
    // I considered getting an unsupported message means issue in the client side
    return Err(io::Error::new(ErrorKind::InvalidData, e));
}

```

---
### Error Handling when unsupported messages received

description: if a server received an unsupported message it should either request for it to be resent again or drop the connection since it's now could be considered corrupted (depend on the case)
<br>
I implemented to return an error to drop the thread (also the stream will be closed when the thread exits).
```rust
 // Handle any unrecognized message types (though unlikely)
_ => {

    error!("Received an unknown or unsupported message");
   
    // note the return Err here will cause the thread to exit
    // I considered getting an unsupported message means issue in the client side
    return Err(io::Error::new(ErrorKind::Unsupported, "Unknown message type"));
}
```

## Enhancements
### Multi Tasking
while coding for multi-threading I knew two options
1. **Spawn new thread for every connection** (Chosen Solution)
   <br>
   description: the server waits for new connection and when it has one it creates a new thread with the stream in it to process
   - Advantages
     <br>
      - only use number of threads that we need. So, no reserved resources is not used.
   - Disadvantages
     <br>
      - opening a lot of connections in the same time and exhaust the server resources and may cause a `denial-of-service` if the server crashed.
        <br>
2. **Using thread pool**
   <br>
   description: the server create a pool of threads (also called workers) and assign a thread with a client. the number of threads is determined before creating the pool.
   - Advantages
     <br>
      - good for preventing resources exhausting.
      - good for limiting number of open connections in the same time.
   - Disadvantages
     <br>
      - the number of threads of the pool actually is reserved for the threads only. (ex: thread pool with number of threads 500 -> 500 running threads even if there is no connection active)
      - choosing number of the threads in the pool opens an optimization problem to determine the best value for it (which  may be a headache if the load is changing).

---
### Send function for the Client
since handling different messages, but they are all from `server_message.Message` Enum, I unified the send function. to support all send classes.

```rust
pub fn send(&mut self, message: server_message::Message) -> io::Result<()> {

   // create buffer to hold the encoding
   let mut buffer = Vec::new();
   message.encode(&mut buffer);

   // Send the buffer to the server
   self.stream.write_all(&buffer)?;
   self.stream.flush()?;

   println!("Sent message: {:?}", message);
   Ok(())
}
```
